VPS is short for a Virtual Private Server. VPS hosting is one of the most popular hosting services you can choose for your website. It uses virtualization technology to provide you with dedicated (private) resources on a server with multiple users.
It’s a more secure and stable solution than shared hosting where you don’t get a dedicated server space. However, it’s smaller-scale and cheaper than renting an entire server.
VPS solutions usually offer more than one hosting plan. For instance, at routerhosting, we have Large VPS Plans to suit different business needs

How does vps work in forex trading
When a forex VPS hosting service is set up, the trader gets allocated an IP address, along with a username and password, to gain access to the system. A programme, called “Remote Desktop Connection,” is provided for a Windows-based operating system, which can simply be accessed using the start menu button. After the login details are entered, traders can access a “virtual desktop,” where they can download the MT4 platform or simply upload Expert Advisors (EAs) to the VPS.
Traders gain huge control over the PC, VPS connection with EAs and the broker’s MT4 server, none of which requires 24/7 uptime at the trader’s end. The installed EAs will send orders to the MT4 servers autonomously, which means that network uptimes are maintained through the day, regardless of whether the trader’s computer is on or linked to an internet connection.
